#difference between the "insert()" and "append()" methods when adding elements to a list 
list = ['A',1,"Ashish"]
list.append(100)
print(list)
list.insert(2,"piyush")
print(list)

#when we use append it will add the element to list at the end
#when we use insert it will add the element to list at the position you have mentioned.
